# 42 Piscine C Exercises

Welcome to my 42 Piscine repository! This repository includes my solutions for the C programming exercises as part of the **42 Piscine** program. Here, you'll find various tasks and projects I completed to deepen my understanding of low-level programming.

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific exercise or project. Inside each folder, you'll find:
- **Source code**: `.c` files with my solutions
- **README** files (if applicable): Brief explanations of the exercises and any notable approaches used

## About the 42 Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is an intensive bootcamp by [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage) designed to teach programming fundamentals, working in group, time managment, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking with a focus on C programming.
